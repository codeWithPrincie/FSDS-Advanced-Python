    "5.   Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. It allows you to create a new class (called the child class or subclass) that      inherits the attributes and methods from an existing class (called the parent class or superclass). The child class        can then extend or modify the behavior of the parent class.The syntax for creating a subclass and specifying                inheritance in Python is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, encapsulation can be achieved to a certain extent through naming conventions and access modifiers. However,      Python does not provide strict access modifiers like some other programming languages (e.g., private, protected,            public) to enforce encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Python uses naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of variables and methods. By convention, variables      and methods that are intended to be private are prefixed with a single underscore _, indicating that they are intended      for internal use within the class or module. However, this naming convention is merely a convention and does not            enforce strict encapsulation."

    "7.   How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, class variables and instance variables are two different types of variables that are associated with a          class and its instances, respectively. Here are the key differences between class variables and instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. Class Variables: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class               scope, but outside any class methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name or the instance name.\n",
    "        Instance Variables: Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class. They are defined within the               instance methods or the constructor (__init__) of the class. Instance variables are accessed using the instance             name.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Memory Allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. Class Variables: Class variables are allocated memory only once when the class is defined. They are stored in the           class object itself and are shared among all instances. Any modification to a class variable affects all instances         of the class.\n",
    "        Instance Variables: Instance variables are allocated memory separately for each instance of the class. Each                 instance has its own copy of instance variables, and modifications to instance variables are specific to that               instance only.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Access and Modification:\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. Class Variables: Class variables can be accessed and modified directly using the class name or any instance of the         class. Any modification to a class variable is reflected in all instances.\n",
    "        Instance Variables: Instance variables are accessed and modified using the instance name. Each instance has its own         set of instance variables, and modifications are specific to that instance only."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the self parameter is used in class method definitions to refer to the instance of the class itself. It is      typically the first parameter in instance methods, allowing the method to access and manipulate the instance variables      and other instance-specific attributes."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, reflection methods, such as __getattr__, __setattr__, __getattribute__, and __setattribute__, are used to        customize attribute access and manipulation behavior in objects. These methods are part of the Python object protocol      and provide a way to intercept and modify attribute access and assignment operations.\n",

    "Ans. The __iadd__ method in Python is called when the += (in-place addition) operator is used on an object. It stands for        \"in-place add\" and is used to implement the in-place addition operation, which modifies the object itself by adding        another object to it."

    "\n",
    "     If you need to customize the behavior of the __init__ method within a subclass, you can override the method by              defining it in the subclass itself. By providing a new implementation of the __init__ method in the subclass, you can      modify or extend the initialization behavior specific to that subclass."
